# Shortest Path Algorithm in Python

## Overview
This Python program implements the **Dijkstra's Algorithm** to find the shortest path in a graph. The user can input a graph and the start and end nodes to find the shortest path.

## Features
- Implements Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.
- Handles directed and undirected graphs.
- Takes dynamic inputs for graph edges and nodes.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open a terminal/command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder containing the `shortest_path.py` file.
4. Run the command:
